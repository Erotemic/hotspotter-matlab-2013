# hotspotter-matlab-2013

This is a release of code for historical purposes. 

This is the original code the 2013 HotSpotter publication was based on: 
https://github.com/Erotemic/crall-hotspotter-wacv-2013

Shortly after this (and partly during the conference itself), the code was
ported to python:
https://github.com/Erotemic/hotspotter

In 2014 (after learning a lot about Python), it was restructured into a new
package IBEIS (which as of 2022 I still maintain):
https://github.com/Erotemic/ibeis

In 2017, it resulted in my thesis:
https://github.com/Erotemic/crall-thesis-2017

And then the algorithms from IBEIS were consolidated into wildbook-ia:
https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wildbook-ia


Note, I seemed to have two versions in my archive, one named "Zebras" and the
other named "Transfer". I think "Zebras" is the latest given the timestamps,
but I included both in case there is any major difference. "Transfer" seems
to have code that "Zebras" doesn't have.
